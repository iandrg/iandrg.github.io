                    <h2>Understanding the climate-tectonic interaction in Western Amazonia (Acre Basin) during the
                        Quaternary using luminescence techniques</h2>
                    <p class="meta"><strong>Universidade de São Paulo/FAPESP, 2020-2022</strong></p>
                    <p class="abstract">Though some numerical ages are available for the Quaternary sedimentary record
                        for the Solimões and Amazonas Basins, the Quaternary stratigraphic record and its timing in the
                        Acre Basin is poorly known. This is critical to evaluate if landscape changes driven by
                        tectonics and/or climate influenced species distribution in Amazonia during the Quaternary, the
                        critical period for biotic diversification. To understand the relationship between tectonism and
                        climate and their role for landscape changes in lowland Amazonia during the Quaternary, it is
                        mandatory to obtain a detailed chronology of the sedimentary record and the sediment source
                        areas that allow to correlate the studied sedimentary deposits from the Acre Basin with nearby
                        basins and tectonic phases. With this post-doctoral proposal, we aim to use different
                        luminescence signals to produce a detailed age model of the sedimentary record from selected
                        locations in the Acre Basin and to obtain exhumation rates from the sediment source areas from
                        the Andes. This will be accomplished collecting samples from outcrops and from drill cores
                        extracted under the Trans-Amazon Drilling Project (International Continental Scientific Drilling
                        Project, ICDP). For determination of sedimentation ages, we will use diverse luminescence dating
                        techniques, including dating protocols recently developed, that allow to increase the age limit
                        of the dating method to time scales of 10^5 to 10^6 years. Low temperature thermochronology
                        analysis using luminescence signals from bedrock samples from the Andes Cordillera and from
                        samples collected during drilling will provide exhumation and subsidence rates for the Andes
                        Cordillera and the Acre Basin, respectively, for the Quaternary.</p>

                    <h2>Characterization of the origin of the interfluve of the Orinoco and Amazon rivers and its
                        influence on paleoenvironments and biota diversification</h2>
                    <p class="meta"><strong>Universidade Federal de São Paulo/FAPESP, 2021-2022</strong></p>
                    <p class="abstract">Despite the growing recognition that fluvial dynamics play an important role in
                        shaping the Amazonian landscape and driving biota diversification, there is a lack of
                        information on the timing and mechanisms controlling changes in the Amazonian fluvial system
                        over time. This knowledge gap arises from the absence of robust dating for Late Cenozoic
                        (Neogene and Quaternary) geological records and the lack of suitable proxies for comparing
                        ancient and modern fluvial systems. This is particularly true for the plains and sub-Andean
                        regions of northwestern Amazonia, encompassing the Caquetá and Guaviare rivers, which drain the
                        interfluve of the Amazon and Orinoco basins, respectively. This research project employs an
                        integrated approach based on geological, geochronological, and phylogeographic methods to
                        reconstruct the paleogeographic history of northwestern Amazonia and its effects on biotic
                        evolution during the Neogene and Quaternary. By incorporating new techniques, we aim to produce
                        one of the most detailed records ever generated on the landscape evolution of the fluvial system
                        draining the Amazon-Orinoco interfluve. This record will enable us to address fundamental
                        questions about (1) the timing and mechanisms of the separation between the Amazon and Orinoco
                        basins, (2) the response of fluvial systems to climatic and tectonic changes, and (3) how
                        changes in floodplains impact the evolution of birds and plants at different temporal scales. An
                        important aspect of our proposal is to deepen existing collaborations between Brazilian and
                        Colombian researchers, who use geological and biogeographical data to test and refine landscape
                        evolution models. The data generated will significantly improve these models, ultimately
                        contributing to more accurate predictions of future changes in rivers and Amazonian
                        biodiversity. It will also support scientists and decision-makers in devising intelligent and
                        effective conservation strategies and mitigating environmental impacts.</p>

                    <h2>The potential of quartz and feldspar for luminescence dating of sediments of the Atacama Desert
                    </h2>
                    <p class="meta"><strong>Universidad Católica del Norte/CIGIDEN, 2016-2019</strong></p>
                    <p class="abstract">Numerical dating is of great importance to understand the climatic and tectonic
                        evolution of the Atacama Desert during the Quaternary. However, due to the hyperaridity, some
                        dating material is not available. Quartz and potassium feldspar are ubiquitous in the Atacama
                        Desert and therefore, optical dating techniques as optically stimulated luminescence present a
                        great opportunity. Here, we aim to describe the luminescence properties of quartz and potassium
                        feldspar to evaluate their suitability for OSL dating. Obtaining reliable ages offer the
                        possibility to better understand the Late Quaternary evolution of the Atacama Desert as well as
                        to improve the knowledge about natural hazards that affect northern Chile.</p>

                    <h2>Late Quaternary evolution of the tectonic uplift in northern Chile</h2>
                    <p class="meta"><strong>Universidad Católica del Norte/CIGIDEN, 2014-2019</strong></p>
                    <p class="abstract">The geomorphology of the Mejillones Peninsula, northern Chile, evidences a
                        Quaternary tectonic uplifting and normal faulting process. The upper plate faults located closer
                        to the peninsula show undifferentiated Quaternary activity. However, there is no consensus about
                        the uplift rate of the Mejillones Peninsula and numeric ages allowing to establish the most
                        recent geologic history of the upper plate faults are scarce. The main aim of this project is to
                        contribute to a better knowledge of the subduction process and upper plate deformation
                        relationship through the quantification of the coastal uplift and the upper plate fault activity
                        in the Mejillones Peninsula for the Late Quaternary applying luminescence dating techniques.</p>
